# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
We were tasked by the an employee of the Colorado Board of Elections to audit a local congressional election. They asked us to do the following:
1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of the candidates who received votes.
3. The percentage of total votes that each candidate received.
4. The total number of votes that each candidate received.
5. Determine the winner of the election through popular vote.

## Resources
Data Source: election_results.csv

Software used: Python 3.8.8, Virtual Studio Code Version: 1.57.0

## Summary
Using Python we were able to write a script that will allow the Election Commission to use this script in future elections to determine the number of votes cast overall, in each county, and for each candidate. Results are below.
